lab0.c:
	In lab0.c, the main thing it does is to take the content
from the input file to the output file under some specification.

1. Implementation of options
   In order to read the input and output file argument, we have
to include the library getopt.h. To use the library, we need to
create struct for the long option first to specify whether
those options needs to take arguments or not.

2. Implementation of file reading and writing
   open(): get the file descriptor
   close():close a file descriptor
   dup():copy a file descriptor to STDIN_FILENO
   read():read according to the file descriptor
   write():write according to the file descriptor

3. Structure
   a.Get the option information
   b.Execute the corresponding options

Makefile:
1. Compilation of lab0.c
   Compile the code

2. Check test cases
   Checked 7 test cases

3. Clean
   remove all the input and output files created by check,
   and remove executable file

4. dist
   tar the source code, Makefile, README and gdb screenshot
gdb:
1. Run gdb
   Simply type "gdb lab0" to start 

2. Execute program via gdb with stack backstrace
   When it shows the segmentation fault, type "bt full"
   to get the information of each variables in the stack

3. Set breakpoints through gdb
   break "Line number"
