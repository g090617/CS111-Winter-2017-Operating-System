This is the submission for lab 1c

I implement profile for lab 1c, basically just create 
some time struct and then use getrusage to get the 
user time and system time

This program have several limitations:
The program can correctly pass all the test case, 
but can most contain about 100 file descriptors, 
since the array size is 100

The array size of pipe array is also 100, which
 means the program can contain 50 pairs of pipes

the command_arg size is 100, for each subcommand, 
it can contains 100 chunks of shell command

command_info is also an array of 100, indicates 
that the total number of command information it
 is able to store is 100
