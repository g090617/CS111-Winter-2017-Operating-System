lab3a.c:
	This is the source code file that reads from the disk-image
file system, creates csv files to store the results in the csv file

Makefile:
	Makefile compiles the program and tarball the necessary files

Limitation:
	It takes about 3 minutes for the program to finish mounting 
the file system and store the output to the csv files.
    	The main reason that is causing it slowing down is because
	the system call dprintf, because it was pretty fast when I
	was trying to print out the result onto the monitor
	I tried using fprintf but it just give me the incorrect
	result which I have no idea why.


Implementation outline:
	Part1,2 in different function
	Part3,4,5,6 in the same function
	since it is more convenient to directly working on the inodes
	and directories when we notice whether an inode is free or not.
